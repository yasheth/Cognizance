It is however permissible to make minor repairs.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Course Time : Time is measured from the time the robot crosses the starting line until the time it crosses the finish line. A robot is deemed to have crossed the line when the forward most wheel, track, or leg of the robot contacts or crosses over the line.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Autonomous Control : Once a robot has crossed the starting line it must remain fully autonomous, or it will be disqualified.An area around the field will be designated as the GAME ZONE. No one is allowed inside the game zone except for the robot handlers and the referees.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Losing the Line : Any robot that loses the line course must reacquire the line at the point where it was lost, or at any earlier (e.g. already traversed) point.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Second Attempt : Any robot that loses the line course and fails to reacquire it will be allowed a single reattempt. The robot must start the course again from the beginning, and if it loses the line course on its second attempt it will be disqualified.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TRIAL : There is no limit for the number of restarts within the TRIAL period.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring : RACE TIME is the time considered for tracing the route from START to FINISH. RACE TIME is calculated automatically by the on-field optical sensors that detect the robot&rsquo;s movement. The robot that will have the fastest run will win the competition.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Team Specifications :<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A team can contain a maximum of 4 members. (Participants of same or different institutions can also collaborate). Every team must have a unique name to it. All the important communications between the teams and CZ&#39;17 will be done through their team representative. Thus, the team representative must submit their valid contact details (Phone number, email ID, etc.) at the time of registration. The coordinators would not be held responsible for any kind of electromagnetic interference in wireless communication.

The tools and features that make up Revit Architecture are specifically designed to support building information modeling (BIM) workflows. By utilizing BIM as opposed to computer-aided drafting (CAD), Revit Architecture is able to leverage dynamic information in intelligent models &mdash; allowing complex building structures to be accurately designed and documented in a short amount of time. Each intelligent model created with Revit Architecture represents an entire project and is stored in a single database file.<o:p><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n","dept":"CL","subid":"6","fees":"1000","number_of_participants":"2","coordinator":"<p>\r\n\tAjay Agrawal - &nbsp;7567315648<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHinal Modi - &nbsp;9537247532<\/p>\r\n","date_time":"13\/14th Sept","venue":"ME\/CL building","eventid":"CL06"},"IT05":{"id":"49","name":"Android App Development Workshop Powered by Google Developers Group (Workshop)","one_line_description":"\r\n\tStill downloading the apps from Google Play Store!!!
